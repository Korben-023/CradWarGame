Task 1: PythonCardWar game (30 marks):

You are tasked with creating and enhancing the PythonCardWar game to make it more
engaging and feature-rich. In the current version, players simply draw cards and determine the
winner based on card values. Your goal is to add new features, improve the user experience,
and apply your programming skills to make the game more exciting. The game should be
written in python and ensure Functions, Methods are utilized. Applying OOP principles can lead
to additional marks however, this is optional.


Requirements

− Player Names- Allow players to enter their names at the beginning of the game so that the
game can address them by name.

− Rounds Limit - Implement a feature that allows you to set a limit on the number of rounds
played. The game should announce the winner when the limit is reached, even if one player
doesn't have any cards left.

− Scorekeeping - Keep track of the score throughout the game. A player earns a point for
each round they win. Display the score after each round.

− Special Cards-Introduce special cards with unique effects. For example, you can create an
"Ace of Hearts" that allows the player who draws it to take another turn or a "Joker" card
that resets the score.

− Optional: Save and Load - Allow the option to save the game state to a file and load it later.
This feature is optional but can be a good challenge.

− Challenge - Implement a custom rule or feature of your choice to make the game more
exciting
